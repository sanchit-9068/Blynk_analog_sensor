First upload the edgent example of blynk library on the NodeMCU with whatever changes you want.
Then go on the app and add new device (if first time adding this device)
Then search for the device and connect to a wifi
After connecting to the wifi the serial monitor will show ready and then youo can see your values.
You need to add the widgets in the app and assign a virtual pin to them.
In case the values don't update just press the reset button of the NodeMCU and click on the screen.
